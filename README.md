# fourbar
A flask web-application to conduct position, velocity, and acceleration analysis on standard fourbar linkage mechanisms. This application was created by me during the course ED4060 Design of Mechanical Systems 2. 

The application takes in as input the lengths of the four bars and the angular position of the secondary linkage bar with respect to the ground, and gives all possible position configurations with corresponding velocity and acceleration values, along with a detailed step-by-step mathematical solution. 

The application is hosted on www.fourbar.herokuapp.com
